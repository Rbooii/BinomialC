# 🎰 Casino-Style Exploitation of the Binomial Equation
This project explores how casinos leverage the binomial equation to ensure long-term profitability in gambling games. By analyzing probability distributions, house edge, and expected values, we can mathematically demonstrate why "the house always wins."

## 📌 Features:
* Binomial Probability Models 🧮 – Simulating common casino games (e.g., roulette, blackjack, dice rolls).

*  Value Calculation 📊 – Understanding how small edges translate into huge profits over time.

* Profit Simulation 💰 – Running Monte Carlo experiments to visualize long-term casino earnings.

## 🔍 Why This Matters:
This project serves as a real-world application of probability and statistics, showing how minor advantages in probability can lead to massive financial gains—a fundamental principle behind casino operations.
