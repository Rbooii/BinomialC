how to compile cpp using clang on mac
exec command : clang++ -std=c++17 -o main main.cpp

"main" will be the file name so for execute program just run "./main"
-std=c++17 will use cpp version 17 standard compiling machine to convert to binary
clang++ will be the compiler program name because clang is the app provided by mac xcode thing
main.cpp is the file that we are compiling, if the file name changes this need to change too!
